# Computer vision
## Prerequisites
OpenCV needs to be installed on your system and have the build and bin folder added to your system path: <br>
`[YOUR LOCATION]\opencv\build` - Needed for the cmake command 'find_package()' to work. <br>
`[YOUR LOCATION]\opencv\build\x64\vc15\bin` - So that there is access to OpenCV executables. <br>

## Build
You can click `build.bat` to build the project for VS17 2022 or edit the bat file to build for other IDE.
